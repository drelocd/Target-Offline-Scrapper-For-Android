# Target-Offline-Scrapper-For-Android
Scrape Product data from Target StoreFronts Using Pydroid3 on Android
This is meant to work on storefront urls only. For a general scrapper contact me on https://nexorasolutions.co.ke
REQUIREMENTS 
PYDROID3 Installed
Steps to Run
Create a folder called target_pages in your device root storage folder
Navigate to your Target Storefront that you want to scrape and download all the pages
Make sure the pages are fully loaded before downloading. Save the downloaded files incrementally in the target_pages folder i.e target.html, target.html(1), target.html(2) etc
Copy the contents of scrapper.py to your Pydroid3 editor and run
The results are saved as target_products.csv to your device root folder
